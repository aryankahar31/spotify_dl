# Spotify to YouTube MP3 Downloader

This Python project allows you to convert a Spotify track to an MP3 file by searching for its lyrics on YouTube and downloading the audio. The script uses the **Spotipy** library to fetch track metadata from Spotify, **yt-dlp** for downloading YouTube audio, and **pytube** for searching YouTube videos.

## Features

- Fetches track metadata (title, artist, album) from Spotify.
- Searches for the song on YouTube using the song title and artist name.
- Downloads the audio from YouTube as an MP3 file.
- Automatically saves the audio in the `downloads` folder.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `spotipy` library for interacting with the Spotify API.
- `yt-dlp` library for downloading YouTube videos.
- `pytube` library for searching YouTube videos.

## Installation

1. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install spotipy yt-dlp pytube
   ```

2. Obtain Spotify API credentials by following the steps in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
   - Create a new Spotify Developer application to get the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.

3. Replace the following variables in the script with your credentials:
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-to-youtube-mp3.git
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

3. Enter a Spotify track URL when prompted:
   ```plaintext
   Enter Spotify track URL: https://open.spotify.com/track/xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

4. The script will fetch the metadata from Spotify, search for the song on YouTube, and download the MP3 version of the audio to the `downloads` folder.

```plaintext
Enter Spotify track URL: https://open.spotify.com/track/1z0gHzFC9B2iLfeANn9Z9J

### Instructions for Adding the README to Your GitHub Repository:

1. Navigate to the root of your Git repository where your Python script is located.
   
2. Create a file named `README.md`:
   - You can create it manually using a text editor or with the following command:
     ```bash
     touch README.md
     ```

3. Open the `README.md` file in a text editor and paste the content provided above.

4. Save the file.

5. Add, commit, and push the `README.md` to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add README file"
   git push origin main
   ```

Now your repository will include a detailed `README.md` file to explain how to use your project!
